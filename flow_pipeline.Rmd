# Installations
```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")


# Installing the "basic" flow cytometry packages.  They all live on a repository called Bioconductor.
install.packages("BiocManager")

#You can either do library(BiocManager) and install("flowCore) or what I have done below.
BiocManager::install("flowCore") #interpret .fcs files
BiocManager::install("flowViz") #basic visulisation
BiocManager::install("ggcyto") #advanced visulisation using the ggPlot nomenclature
BiocManager::install("openCyto") #Used to link various analysis methodologies
BiocManager::install("flowWorkspace") #used to build anaysis templates
BiocManager::install("CytoML") #imports FlowJo and DiVA workspaces

#These packages largly require each other to work (except flowCore which is the "base package) 
#so will often load each other without my help.  For simplicty I have loaded them all.

#You will need to "clean" your data.  flowAI and flowCut are my recomendations.  
#flowClean is the original, but is supeceeded by flowCut
BiocManager::install("flowAI")
BiocManager::install("flowClean")

#flowCut is not available on bioconductor and needs to be laoded straight from GitHub.  TO do this you need the package devtools.
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmeskas/flowCut")

#An intresting project is CytoExploreR that trys to blend the power of R with the ease of use of a mouse.
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoExploreRData")
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/CytoExploreR",build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Libraries
